Project 3 - Personal Health Tracker

## Overview:

An application that tracks and records daily symptoms with a corresponding chart of data. With the lack of symptom tracker applications available, R.U.O.K. provides symptom monitoring through recording daily symptoms. This data is recorded and depicted through provided charts detailing the occurrence rate of each symptom.

## Purpose:

This app was designed as a tool for people with long-term health conditions, and allows them to track symptoms as often as they like. Those symptoms are then visualized for the user on charts for easy access.
